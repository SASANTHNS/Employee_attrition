# Employee Attrition Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This project presents an **Employee Attrition Dashboard** that visualizes key trends and patterns in employee turnover. The dashboard provides insights into which factors influence employee attrition, such as income, job satisfaction, age, and more. The goal is to help HR teams and management identify potential areas for improvement in employee retention strategies.

## Objectives

- **Visualize Employee Attrition**: Provide a clear overview of employee attrition rates segmented by demographic factors, income, job satisfaction, and other key metrics.
- **Analyze Attrition Drivers**: Help identify specific factors contributing to higher attrition rates, including salary, years in the company, and time since last promotion.
- **Support HR Decision-Making**: Offer actionable insights to HR teams to improve employee retention and reduce attrition rates across different departments.

## Key Metrics Visualized in the Dashboard

   - Displays a breakdown of the **1,470 total employees**, segmented by active employees (1,233) and those who have left (237).
   
2. **Attrition Rate**:

   - Example: **R&D Department** shows 237 employees, with an attrition rate of **16.1%**.

3. **Attrition by Income**:

7. **Attrition by Job Level and Distance**:
   - Shows attrition rates by job level combined with the distance employees live from the workplace.
